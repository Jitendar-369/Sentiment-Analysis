Sentiment Analysis Project
Overview
This project implements a Sentiment Analysis Application that classifies text into various sentiment categories (e.g., positive, negative, neutral). It utilizes a machine learning model trained on text data and employs TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical features for classification.

Usage
Start the Streamlit application to analyze sentiment from user-input text:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run main.py
Files
main.py: Runs the Streamlit web app, allowing users to input text and get sentiment predictions.
model.h5: The pre-trained Keras deep learning model for sentiment classification.
tfidf.pkl: The serialized TF-IDF vectorizer, used for converting text into numerical form.
requirements.txt: Lists the necessary Python packages to run the project.
data/: Contains training/testing datasets (if applicable).
Data
The data/ directory should contain the dataset files used for training and testing. Ensure that the correct file paths are referenced in the code.
